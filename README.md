And we store the data as follow into a excel file and used for the subsequent analysis

`Register Data`:

| *Register Date | Event Type | Title | Material Type |

*Event type*: study, review, misc

`Record Data`:

| *Date | Level | *Time Usage | Progress | Completed |


or I can register an event, so I don't need to type a lot of the same thing everytime.

every time I click, for example, study, it will pop out a window and ask to start a registered event or register a new one


## Misc thoughts

calculate avg difficulty level

what about online resources? they don't have a certain criteria

I can also record the work out time and period, like morning, afternoon or evening, to find out which period works best for me!
